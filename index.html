    <p> ...People are actually visiting this? Damn, okay. I made this website because Neil wore down my (super awesome, by the way) defenses with his wiles and persuasive skills. This satiated him, but I have exams right now so it's a little barebones, to say the least. Planning to redesign it after they end, I already have a vision for it but we'll see how 𝖨̶ ̶𝖿̶𝗎̶𝖼̶𝗄̶ ̶𝗂̶𝗍̶ ̶𝗎̶𝗉̶ it plays out. In the meantime, enjoy this introductory rant on fountain pens (I have more locked and loaded..somewhere in the archives): </p>
    <br><br>
    <p>
        Fountain pens have a wide range of filling systems,  ranging from cartridge, converter (there are different types of these) piston filling, vacuum filling, eyedropping and more (I've written a para on this already but can't find it right now) 
<br>
Anyway for cartridges it's pretty simple, all you have to do is push the cartridge into the section and (if the pen is new or just washed/flushed) scribble on a rough sheet for a few secs until the ink starts flowing. You can also choose to flush the feed with ink. Converters are like cartridges in that they hold ink, but you can put any bottled ink in them and they're much less wasteful than cartridges. Tbf you could also syringe ink into an empty cartridge but that would be wise only for pens with converters the company still hasn't made a better option for (eg. Pilot's CON-40 used in the vanishing point/decimo) (theres a difference bw the 2)
<br>
The TWSBI Eco and other pens are piston fillers and hold a larger volume of ink directly in the barrel. Just twist the piston down and submerge the nib inside the ink bottle, then twist up.  You can't syringe ink into these ones (and vacuum fillers for that matter like the twsbi diamond series iirc though i can't really remember)

    <p>You could contact me by either (hey I'm too lazy to make a list right now ok procrastination is a terrible thing): 1) contacting neil, who will probably redirect you to 2) shooting a message via discord: donutlord6829 </p>
